        This is <strong>VERY work in progress</strong>  and more or less just a proof of concept of a real-time</br>
        3D ray-tracing engine built in javascript. I had been reading up on ray casting and tracing and thought i'd</br>
        take a crack at writing one in JS. Of course this would be more efficient in a C like language but, I like the</br>
        portability of javascript running in a web browser!
